# Overview

Hey folks, I figured I'd try to learn how to do some modern front-end development.

I began where I left off, which was SPAs with AngularJS 1 (yes, the first version) which would communicate with backend RESTful APIs with JSON as the interchange format.

Apparently JAMstack (Javascript, APIs, Markdown) is the "bees-knees" and I began to expore this space.

For technologies (viz., libraries and frameworks) and I stumbled across Vue.js + Gridsome, React + Gatsby, React.js + Next.js.

After reading a bunch about front-end architecture, I settled on Next.js + React.js.

Currently, this is based on the starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).
